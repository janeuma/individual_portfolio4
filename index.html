        <h2>Baltimore</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Clarksville, MD but moved to Baltimore when I was nine. I like living in Baltimore a lot better, probably because I was already going to school in Baltimore, so now I lived closer to my friends. It is also home to the best crab cakes in America. They are not like other state’s crab cakes, trust me. I go to the same crab cake restaurant as Oprah, called Pappa’s Seafood Co., and they even ship crab cakes nationwide. I spend most of my weekends during the summer at Bethany Beach, DE. Even though Delaware is so close to Maryland, the crab cakes are not the same. </p>

        <h2>Schools</h2>
        <p>I went to school, K-8 at a Jewish Day School called Krieger Schechter Day School and I loved it. In eighth grade, I was in an all Hebrew version of the musical Oklahoma (אוקלהומה), I am not good at acting or singing, so I got a part in the cowboy ensemble (shown in picture). However, due to my height I was put in the front row, and stage fought another vertically challenged girl during the fight between the cowboys and the farmers. I spent a lot of time getting yelled at by the director because apparently, “we fake fought like girls”. At the end of eight grade, my whole class took a two-week trip to Israel (I talk about on traveling page). After middle school, I decided to go to a public high school. I went to Pikesville High School and the most notable experience I had there was a four year class on Interactive Media Production where I learned how to use Adobe Photoshop (and got certified), Premiere, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver. In addition, I had to make a fifty five second Rube Goldberg project (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8CyMfANJxs" class="link">link to video is here</a>).

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I have a big family, three siblings (plus three more through marriage), three nephews, two nieces, ten aunts and uncles, fifteen cousins (not including spouses), twenty first cousins once removed. I am the youngest of four siblings (shown in the picture), by a lot and the only left-handed one. My oldest sister, Randi, is eighteen years older than me and she is essentially my second mom. My brother, Richard, is fourteen years older than me, and my other sister, Adriana, is eleven years older than me. I also became an aunt when I was ten and today, I have two nieces and three nephews. Honestly, I hated essentially being an only child my whole life since all my siblings had moved out, but having nieces and nephews filled that void. I also have two dogs that I love a lot, a Havanese poodle named Lilah and a Japanese chin named Katan. I also used to have a pet chinchilla named Jasmine and a few hamsters. When I was little, my sister had a pet tarantula named Casper. My grandmother on my dad’s side was a Holocaust survivor who was saved in Albania. I made a website to compile her interviews, articles, speeches, etc. (<a href="http://johannaneumann.wixsite.com/website" class="link">Link to website is here</a>). My grandfather on my dad’s side went to graduate school at MIT for computer engineering and knew a very rare dialect of German that made him very valuable to the National Holocaust Museum.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I went to a Jewish Day Camp called Beth Tfiloh. For fifteen summers in a row, I was a camper, then a counselor. It is a huge camp in Baltimore, three pools, sixty acres of land, goats, splash pad, lake, playground, and more. I was so excited when I was done being a camper and I moved into the Leadership training program for three-to-five-year-old girls, soon transitioning into a counselor for boys the same age. Boys at that age are super difficult, but working at camp was really rewarding nevertheless. I also played tennis for many years until senior year of high school. For many years, I went to tennis camp at the same place that I practiced,with the same coaches leading. I went to a few US Opens those are super fun. I had some ankle problems get in the way of Tennis. Two surgeries and one screw later, I am still in pain, but not as bad as a few years ago. I just got back into tennis through playing in intramural sports in college. In high school, I was super involved in BBYO, a Jewish youth group. I was the president of my chapter and we grew tremendously during my time as president. One of the best experiences I had was hosting students from Argentina for a week before the international convention in Baltimore that year.
